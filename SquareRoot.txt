HOW TO SOLVE x=sqrt(5) USING MULTIPLICATION (In this case to the hundreths place)

Steps:

1. Change form to x*x=5

2. Pick a number that is <= 5/2   (If the number is 3,2,1,0, or a negative this wont work so you will have to guess a number that is roughly between 75%-100% of the number you are trying to find, negatives will be handled later)
Example: 2.5

3. Mulitply your chosen number by itself to get a product
Example: 2.5*2.5 = 6.25

	4. If your pick is over 5 reduce the first digit of your pick by 1    ELSE    4. If your pick is under 5 increase the first digit of your pick by 1
	Example: Ours is over so we will decrease by 1 to create 1.5

	5. Multiply your new pick by itself
	Example: 1.5*1.5=2.25

6.Decide which leading digit creates a product closest to 5
(NOTE: If this does not create 2 values, 1 above and 1 below the value of the sqrted number (In this case 5), continue decreasing/increasing and checking each ones product until that product is less than the sqrted number if the pick was to high or greater than if the pick was to low. 
You should then have the closest number for that values place whos product is to great and for whose product is to low.
Example: 1.5(best too low choice) and 2.5(best to high choice)

Example: 2.5*2.5=6.5 VS. 1.5*1.5=2.25
5-2.25=|2.75|  VS. 5-6.5=|-1.5|
(In this case 2 creates a closer product to 5)

7. Choose the Pick that created the closest product to 5 and keep it in its values place
Example: The 2 in 2.5

8. Having locked in the best digit for that values place above move onto the next digit.

9. Repeat steps 4 5 6 7 and 8 for every digit place you want accounted for in your answer.
Example: If you want your answer to the thousandths place, do steps 4-8 3 times, once for each digit > 2.23 > The answer to the square root of 5... not rounded
