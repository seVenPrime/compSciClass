1. .5, Python divided 1 by 2 creating .5
2. 0, because 1/2 is not an integer
3. 'byebyebyebyebye', wrote the string 5 times
4. Error, Cannot divide a string
5. 1.4, divided 2 by 5 then added 1
6. .6, first did 1+2 in the () then divided by 5
7. Error, sqrt in not defined, probably need to import a library
8. 2.23, After importing the math library the interpreter used the 
   sqrt function to find the sqrt of 5
9. 5.000000000000001, rounding error
10. 0,5,10,15,20, range could be [0,5) which would be 0,1,2,3,4 then those
    would be multiplied by 5 to produce the output
